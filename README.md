Biophysics Cluster for COSMOS at UC Davis
-----------------------------------------

The COSMOS biophysics cluster exposes high school students
to some important physical phenomena relevant to biological 
systems. We begin with basic probability and build toward
temperature dependent random walks / diffusion using classical
Monte Carlo.  We introduce computational approaches in the 
C programming language designed for students with no background
in any programming language and utilize only introductory algebra.
